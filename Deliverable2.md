## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date     | Who did not attend | Meeting notes (very brief)                                       | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info |

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Name1 : Num Meetings

   Name2 : Num Meetings


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: We presented a demo to our professor

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**
- We connected our backend functionality with the front end
- We created a functional UI for our models
  - We can view the models
  - We can save/load the models
  - We can create the models
- We created a way to save and load our models
  - One of our teammates implemented an impressive algorithm for saving to and loading from the disk

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**
- Most of our teammates contributed enough, but there were some that contributed more
- Better communication and time management could have improved this

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**
- We met the expectations for this sprint, creating everything that we planned to
- However, we are still some ways off from finishing the full project

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**
- Yes, our taiga board is fully completed, and we showed it to the professor during our demo

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**
- Yes, same as above

**If not, what went wrong?**
- Nothing went wrong

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**
- We did not work at a consistent rate, some things were done during the middle of the sprint and some were done closer to the deadline. This is evident by the commit logs.

**Did you deliver business value?**
- Yes, we got closer to our end goal by implementing base functionality - UI and backend for basic schedule model management

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**
- Yes
  - Communicate directly with teammates (not in meetings)
  - Start on work early
  - Encourage others to start work early

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**
- We feel optimisitc, because we were able to finish this sprint in its entirety


### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually). Some of the topcs are not needed for the first deliverables (you should know which things you should have done in this Sprint, if you don't then you have probably missed something):
