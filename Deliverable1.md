# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Vladyslav Shvets

**Git Master**: Danylo Rybchynskyi

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Implement US1 and US2

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 2

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

These US will familiarize us with the SCRUM proccess and the legacy code structure.
We think that we can complete them, because we are creating the basic structure and doing basic UI work.
These changes don't alter the original code base a lot.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

Because these USs cover the first half of our project and we only have 2 sprints to finish it.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**
Yes. We will implement basic models that will represent the required information and create GUI visualisation for them withing the legacy Memoranda app.

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend | Meeting notes (very brief)                                                | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info       |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|11/01  | Mykhailo           | Initial meeting with discussing implementation of models and further work | not needed                                       | not needed                           | 15m long - in voice   |
|11/08  | Mykhailo           | Discussing branching and commit strategy, discussing development of UI    | not needed                                       | not needed                           | 18m long - in voice   |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Name1 : Num Meetings

   Name2 : Num Meetings


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: We didn't know that we were supposed to record our sprints

- Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**
- We started learning the foundations of Agile development.
- We fixed a lot of bugs.
- We created models, IO and basic visualisation.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

- Most of the team worked well enough considering our circumstances. Howewer, some of the team members did not read documentation.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

- We met the learning outcome expectation, but we weren't able to fully implement our ideas that could satisfy the product owner.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

- We met most of our goals. But we were not able to fully finish our User stories, because:
    - There was too much work and too little time.
    - Due to the war, one of our group member was unable to work and attend our meetings.
    - Some of our partners did not have experience with gradle and git which gave us some setbacks.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

- We almost completed both of our US.

**If not, what went wrong?**

- We summarized it above

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

- It depends on a team member.

**Did you deliver business value?**

-  We fixed several severe bugs related to opening and closing the application. Otherwise, our features are still in development stage.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

- Learn git best practices. 
    - Branching
    - Commiting
    - Pulling and Pushing

- design before the coding
- more consistend standup planning.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

The team feels a bit pessimistic because of the amount of work and limited time and because of difficult of organization.
